You can directly [attach the service account to a
VM](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/change-service-account).

Alternatively, go to that service account's Keys tab and create a new key:

![Service Account Keys](../../../img/database-access/guides/cloudsql/service-account-keys@2x.png)

Make sure to choose JSON format:

![Service Account New Key](../../../img/database-access/guides/cloudsql/service-account-new-key@2x.png)

Save the file. Your Teleport Database Service will need to use it as GCP
application credentials file.
