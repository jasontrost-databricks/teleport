Assign the Service Account the following IAM roles:

- "Service Account Token Creator" will allow the Database Service to generate
  IAM authentication tokens when connecting to the database as the service account user
  we created above.
- Either "Cloud SQL Viewer" or "Cloud SQL Admin":
  - "Cloud SQL Viewer" will allow the Database Service to automatically download
    your Cloud SQL instance's root CA certificate, but does not support client
    certificate authentication.
  - "Cloud SQL Admin" will allow the Database Service to automatically download
    your Cloud SQL instance's root CA certificate and generate an
    ephemeral client certificate when the GCP instance is configured to
    "Allow only SSL connections."

Assign it the "Service Account Token Creator" role:
