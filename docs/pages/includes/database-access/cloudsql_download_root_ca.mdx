The instance's root certificate is required so Teleport can validate the
certificate presented by the database instance.

The Database Service can automatically download the instance's root certificate
if the service is granted the `cloudsql.instances.get` permission.

Alternatively, you can download `server-ca.pem` file from the Connections tab
under Security section:
