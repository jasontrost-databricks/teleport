Common issues and resolution steps.

## Auto-login does not work

### Smart card service not running

You connect to a Windows host from the Teleport UI, land on the Windows login
screen and nothing happens.

You can click on the username, click `Sign-in options` and click on the smart
card icon. The error message is: **"No Valid Certificates Were Found on This
Smart Card"**.

**Solution:** Enable the Smart Card Service

Usually, this means that the Smart Card service is not running on the target
host.

First, make sure that you [enable the Smart Card service in Group
Policy](./active-directory-manual.mdx#enable-smart-card-authentication).

If that doesn't help, log into the target host directly, open the "Services"
program from the "Start" menu and check that the "Smart Card" service is in the
"Running" state.

If the "Smart Card" service is not running, open PowerShell and run
`gpupdate.exe /force`. This forces a Group Policy sync and should pick up the
service changes.

### Smart card not supported for Account

You connect to a Windows host and get the error message: **"Signing in with a smart card
isn't supported for your account."** or similar.

**Solution:** Review the Security-Kerberos Log on the Windows host for causes.

The Security-Kerberos Windows Event Log provides information on smart card-based
authentication attempts. This Event Log is not enabled by default.
Open the Windows Event Log and navigate to Event Viewer, Application and Services Logs,
Microsoft, Windows, Security-Kerberos, Operational. Enable this Event Log and attempt
to connect with Teleport Web UI to review log entries.

### Smart card certificate not trusted

You connect to a Windows host from the Teleport UI, land on the Windows login
screen and see an error message: **"The smartcard certificate used for
authentication was not trusted"** (or similar).

**Solution:** Import the Teleport CA

This means that the host does not trust the Teleport CA.

First, make sure that you [import the Teleport CA into Group
Policy](./active-directory-manual.mdx#create-the-GPO-for-the-Teleport-certificate).
Note that if you have rotated the Teleport CA since the last import, you need to
fetch the new CA using the following command, replacing <Var name="teleport.example.com" />
with the address of your Teleport cluster:

```code
$ curl -o user-ca.cer https://<Var name="teleport.example.com"/>/webapi/auth/export?type=windows
```

If that doesn't help, log into the target host directly, open PowerShell and
run `gpupdate.exe /force`. This forces a Group Policy update and should pick up
the new CA.

### Smart card PIN not detected

Teleport uses a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate
a smart card PIN for each new desktop session. In order to prevent the smart
card certificate from being used for any purpose other than the initial login,
this PIN is never shared with the Teleport user.

Teleport provides this PIN to the desktop during the RDP connection phase.
If your group policy prevents the desktop from seeing this PIN, the user will
remain at the login screen even though the smart card was detected.

**Solution:** Ensure that group policy allows specifying credentials during
 RDP connection establishment.

Expand Computer Configuration, Administrative Templates, Windows Components,
Remote Desktop Services, and Remote Desktop Session Host.

Under Remote Desktop Session Host, select **Security**.

Right-click **Always prompt for password upon connection**, select **Edit**,
select **Disabled**, then click **OK**.

Note: despite mention of passwords in the name of this policy, no passwords are
sent on the wire. This mechanism is used only to send the smart card PIN.

## New session "hangs"

### Host unreachable

You click **Connect** on a Windows host from the Teleport Web UI, and a new tab opens, but
nothing is displayed other than the top bar. After a while, an error is displayed about a
failed connection.
In most case, this error occurs when the `windows_desktop_service` can't reach the target
Windows host.

**Solution:** Modify firewall rules to allow inbound RDP traffic

First, make sure that you open the RDP port and [allow remote desktop
connections](./active-directory-manual.mdx#allow-remote-desktop-connections)
in the group policy object you have configured for Teleport connections.

If that does not help, check if the target host is online and try to `ping` it
from the Linux server that runs `windows_desktop_service`. If the host is
online but not reachable, there is some other networking barrier in the way,
specific to your infrastructure.

### Hostname does not resolve

Connections to Windows Desktops hang during connection establishment, or the
Teleport debug logs show errors of the form
`couldn't resolve winserver.example.com`.

**Solution:** Ensure Firewall Permits DNS Traffic

For desktops that are automatically discovered via LDAP, Teleport makes DNS
queries against the LDAP server in order to resolve the hostname to an IP
address.

Ensure that your firewalls allow inbound DNS traffic on port `53` from the
instance(s) running Teleport's Windows Desktop Service to the LDAP server
(Active Directory Domain Controller).

## Teleport fails to start

### Incorrect domain

Teleport fails to start with an error similar to:

```text
LDAP Result Code 10 "Referral": 0000202B: RefErr: DSID-0310082F, data 0, 1 access points
"\tref 1: 'xample.com'"
"\x00"
```

**Solution:** Correct Domain

This means that your domain name is likely wrong. Double-check the `domain`
field in the `ldap` section of `windows_desktop_service`.

### Domain controller unreachable

Teleport fails to start with an error similar to:

```text
LDAP Result Code 200 "Network Error": dial tcp ad.example.com:636: i/o timeout
```

**Solution:** Check LDAP Address

This means that your domain controller is down or unreachable. Double-check the
`addr` field in the `ldap` section of `windows_desktop_service`. If it's
correct, check that the domain controller is up and reachable from the server
that runs `windows_desktop_service`.

### Cannot initialize LDAP over TLS

Teleport fails to connect to LDAP on startup. You may see errors similar to:

```text
LDAP Result Code 52 "Unavailable": 00000000: LdapErr: DSID-0C090F78, comment: Error initializing SSL/TLS, data 0, v2580\x00
```

or

```text
connecting to LDAP server: unable to read LDAP response packet: read tcp 172.18.0.5:35970->;172.18.0.4:636: read: connection reset by peer
```

**Solution:**  Enable LDAPS

This means you do not have an LDAP certificate installed on your LDAP servers,
or you are trying to make an insecure connection on port `389`. Teleport requires
secure LDAPS connections, which are typically on port `636`. First, confirm that
you are connecting to the correct LDAPS port. If that doesn't resolve your
issue, you can
[install Active Directory Certificate Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/core-network-guide/cncg/server-certs/install-the-certification-authority)
(AD CS) or
[import](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/enable-ldap-over-ssl-3rd-certification-authority)
your own third party certificate. Note that Active Directory is
[extremely picky](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/enable-ldap-over-ssl-3rd-certification-authority#requirements-for-an-ldaps-certificate)
so take care to generate your certificates correctly.

## Desktops are not discovered via LDAP

### LDAP not yet initialized

Teleport is running, but desktops do not show up in the Web UI. The logs contain
errors similar to:

```
skipping desktop discovery: LDAP not yet initialized
```

**Solution:** Confirm Teleport certificate is installed

The Teleport Desktop Service uses a Teleport-issued certificate to authenticate
with the LDAP server. This error occurs when Teleport is unable to authenticate,
which is often due to its certificate authority not being trusted by Active
Directory.

First, verify that the Teleport CA is present in the LDAP NTAuth store. Run the
following command, modifying the DN for your domain (in this command we use a
domain of example.com)

```
$ certutil -viewstore "ldap:///CN=NTAuthCertificates,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,DC=example,DC=com?caCertificate"
```

You should see a popup window that shows the Teleport CA certificate. If the
Teleport certificate is not present, import it with:

```
$ certutil -dspublish -f <path-to-cert> NTAuthCA
```

Once you've verified that the Teleport certificate is present in LDAP, you
should check whether it has propagated to all desktops. From a desktop that you
would like to connect to, run the following:

```
$ certutil -viewstore -enterprise NTAuth
```

If the popup window does not show the Teleport certificate, and it was present
in LDAP, you can force the desktop to sync with the following command:

```
$ certutil -pulse
```

## Connection attempts fail

### RDP server only uses Standard RDP Security

Attempts to connect to a desktop fail, and the logs show an error similar to:

```
Rdp(RdpError(RdpError { kind: ProtocolNegFailure, message: "Error during negotiation step: the server is configured to only use standard RDP security mechanisms and does not support external security protocols" }))
```

**Solution:** Enable Enhanced RDP security

Standard RDP Security is based on RC4 encryption and is the least secure way
to connect to a Windows host over RDP. Teleport's RDP client requires enhanced
RDP security with TLS.

Enhanced RDP Security is typically enabled by default, but your environment may
be configured to require the legacy security methods.

This configuration is available via group policy at:

```text
Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Remote Desktop Services > Remote Desktop Session Host > Security
```

Look for the "Require use of a specific security layer for remote (RDP)
connections" setting. The setting should be set to **Negotiate** or **SSL**, not
**RDP**.

### RDP connection failed

You click **Connect** on a Windows host from the Teleport Web UI, a new tab opens but
nothing is displayed other than the top bar. You see an error that refers to a
failed RDP connection. You may also see errors similar to:

```text
Rdp(Io(Os { code: 54, kind: ConnectionReset, message: "Connection reset by peer" }))
```

**Solution:** Configure a certificate for RDP connections

This means that the desktop does not support secure cipher suites for TLS
connections.

Make sure that you [configure a certificate for RDP
connections](./active-directory-manual.mdx#step-47-configure-a-certificate-for-rdp-connections).

### Expired smartcard certificate

The login screen displays an error of the form:

```
The smartcard certificate used for authentication has expired. Please contact your system administrator.
```

**Solution:** Check the system clock

Teleport's smartcard certificates are only valid for a short period of time
(roughly 5 minutes). If the system clock on the Teleport auth server and the
target Windows host disagree about the current time, the system may reject the
authentication attempt.

### Enhanced RDP security with CredSSP required

Attempts to connect to a desktop fail, and the logs show an error similar to:

```
Error during negotiation step: the server requires that the client support enhanced RDP security with CredSSP
```

**Solution:** Disable Network Level Authentication (NLA)

This means that the RDP server is requiring NLA.
Teleport currently requires that NLA is disabled in order to perform its
certificate-based passwordless login.

To disable NLA, follow the instructions to [allow remote
desktop connections](./active-directory-manual.mdx#allow-remote-desktop-connections)
in the group policy object you have configured for Teleport connections.
If you are still encountering this error after disabling NLA in Active Directory,
run the following command from the Windows Command prompt as an administrator
to force the policy update:

```code
$ gpupdate.exe /force
```
