The Teleport Web UI is a web-based visual interface from which you can access resources, 
view active sessions and recordings, create and review Access Requests, 
manage users and roles, and more.

This page serves a reference on Web UI features and their usage.

## Joining an active session

The Teleport Web UI allows you to list and join active SSH sessions using a web-based terminal.

You can view the active SSH sessions that you are allowed to list by clicking **Active Sessions** in the navigation sidebar. 
You can only see active sessions if you are assigned a role with `list` access for the `ssh_session` resource. 
For more information about role permissions and access to resources, see [Teleport Access Controls 
Reference](../access-controls/reference.mdx).

From the active sessions list, click **Join** and select a participant mode to join the session: 

- **As an Observer** with read-only access to the session. You can view output but cannot control the session in any way nor 
  send any input.
- **As a Moderator** with permission to watch, pause, or terminate the session. You can view output and forcefully terminate 
  or pause the session at any time, but can't send input.
- **As a Peer** to collaborate in the session. You can view output and send input.

You must have the `join_sessions` allow policy in a role you've been assigned to join sessions in any participant mode. 
For information about how to configure the `join_sessions` allow policy and participant modes for a role, see 
[Configure an allow policy](../access-controls/guides/moderated-sessions.mdx#configure-an-allow-policy).
